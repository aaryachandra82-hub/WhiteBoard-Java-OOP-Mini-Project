## ⚙️ OOP Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation:** Data members like color, coordinates, and brush size are encapsulated in dedicated classes (`DrawPoint`, `Tool`, etc.).  
- **Inheritance:** Specialized tools extend a common base class.  
- **Polymorphism:** Different drawing tools override drawing behaviors.  
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes/interfaces used to define drawing behavior without exposing implementation details.
